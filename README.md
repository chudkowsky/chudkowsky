### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­I am in my 6th semester of Computer Science at Maria Curie-SkÅ‚odowska University

I am working on a zk-proof solution, primarily focused on STARKs, developing smart contracts in Cairo, and exploring Starknet. My work involves programming in Rust with an emphasis on parallelization and asynchronous programming, building a REST API in Rust using reqwest, tokio, and axum.
